# **Core of Python Programming**
## Indexing
● On lists, we have seen about index numbers.

● Negative indexing

Note: The list index always starts with 0. 
Hence, the first element of a list is present at index 0, not 1.

● Calling texts by indexes also works for strings & tuples
## Slicing
● In Python it is possible to access a section of items from the list using the
slicing operator ‘ : ‘ , not just a single item.

● Syntax:

   ○ Mylist[ start : stop : step ]

● Slicing is indexing syntax that extracts a portion from a list. If a is a list, then
a[m:n] returns the portion of a:

○ Starting with postion m

○ Up to but not including n

○ Negative indexing can also be used

● It is more applicable for strings.

● Python uses default step as 1, sometimes no need to tell/put it

● Also default stopping index is the final, still no need to tell for this kinda
purpose
## User Input handling
● On python there are 2 types of inputs

    ○ By input function

    ○ By Arguments

1) By input functions,
 
      ○ Syntax: var = input(“Text you like to display: ”)

     ○ Will accept the input and stores on variable

     2) Arguments
      
● This help us to get the input from the command lines

● Shell: python gtst.py arg1 arg2 arg3

● Syntax:
## Operators
● Operators are special symbols that perform operations on
variables and values.
 For example,

● There are lots of operators type on python:

     a. Arithmetic operators

     b. Assignment Operators

     c. Comparison Operators

     d. Logical Operators

     e. Bitwise Operators

     f. Special Operators

 ## indentations
● Are Just a WhiteSpace which python uses for some of its function. If
there is no proper indentation error then you are doomed. 
## Nested if statements
● We can also use an if statement inside of an if statement. This is known as a
nested if statement.

● Here two requirements have to be true to run the body of condition2 
## Python Loops
● In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

● For example, if we want to show a message 100 times, then we can
use a loop. And print(100) It's just a simple 
example; you can achieve
much more with loops.

● There are 2 types of loops in Python:
   
    ○ For Loop
    ○ While Loop
## For loop
● In Python, the for loop is used to run a block of code for a
certain number of times. It is used to iterate over any
sequences such as list, tuple, string, etc.

● Syntax:

     ○ Sequence is a list,tuple,string or range.
     ○ Val is a variable which will hold the iteration from the sequence.
## While loops
● Python while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is
met.
## break
Break used to exit from an infinite loop.
