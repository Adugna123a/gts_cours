-  shell also called **terminal**
  ### the terminal have 5 parts

          * hostname
          * current directory
          * privilage
          * command place
  ### what is command?
  small programs that do one well.
  
  - ls/ -list directory files
  - cd/  change directory - it is used to change current working place or home

   used to run mulpile command in 1 line
   
   - using 3 methods
  
     - AND(&&)
     - OR(||)
     - pipeing(|)
 ##            AND(&&)
 on AND both command is must be without error
 ## OR(||)
 the operation command will be executed if it have error or not
 ## pieping(|)
 on pipe will hlp you run commands by using the output of the 1st command as the input for the next one.
